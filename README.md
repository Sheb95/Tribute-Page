# Challenge Accepted: Taking the School of Code's Tribute Page to the Next Level
>As of the creation of this README, I am currently a student at the School of Code which is a coding bootcamp in the U.K. One of the tasks to complete before the start of the course was to create a tribute page in accordance to FreeCodeCamp's own Tribute Pahe criteria. However, after reading Abu Taher's article on Medium.com titled "Taking Tribute Challenge to the next level", I was inspired to try and create a tribute page with design in mind. I wanted my page to stand out from the rest of those who had completed the challenge and also learn layout features such as CSS Grid and FlexBox. I also wanted to challenge myself with what I had managed to teach myself and thus decided to take the difficult road with the pre-course project.

>While this page did not fit the criteria and was not formally sumbmitted, it is 1000% better looking than my official submission. The webpage is not as responsive as I would like as I struggled with making CSS Grid as fluidly responsive as possible. However, I am quite proud of the results given that this was my first attempt at not only creating a webpage, but doing so with CSS Grid.
