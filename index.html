                Born in Crenshaw, Los Angeles, California on 15th August 1985, Ermais “Nipsey Hussle” Asghedom was a Grammy-award winning rapper best known for his mixtapes before releasing his debut album “Victory Lap” just only a year prior to his death. The rapper also was an avid businessman. One of his most famous endeavours was his fashion brand, the Marathon Clothing. His aim as a businessman was to economically empower his local deprived neighbourhood and thus, Hussle was also renowned for his community work.

                While Hussle is known mainly for his music and his entrepreneurial activities, he also had an interest in technology. As a teenager, Hussle sought out computer auctions and taught himself how to build a PC from top-to-bottom. It was this very PC that he started off using to record his music and thus was fundamental to his musical development. For him, using his self-taught tech skills was the only financially viable way of producing his own music. “I had to learn how to use software early because I wanted to record myself,” Hussle explained to the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-ms-nipsey-hussle-vector-90-victory-lap-20180228-story.html" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>. “I didn’t have a budget to pay engineers, so I had to learn how to use software myself. Just growing up, being an ‘80s baby that grew up in the ‘90s, technology was a part of culture, so I was always interested in it”.

                Hussle’s interest in technology did not stop when his music gained more notoriety. He developed what he refered to as a <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs97ggiChlQ" target="_blank">“smart store”</a> for his fashion brand in his neighbourhood in 2017. Teaming up with Ghanaian-American software developer Iddris Sandu, Hussle developed an app where users could go into the store and scan the tags of the clothes to stream exclusive digital content. Additionally, In February 2018, Nipsey opened a combination co-working space and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) centre in the Crenshaw district that hoped to serve as a bridge between underrepresented and impoverished groups and corporate partners in Silicon Valley and beyond.

                However, on 31st August 2019, Hussle was tragically shot and killed on the very street he dedicated his life and career investing in at the age of 33 years old.
